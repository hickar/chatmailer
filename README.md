### Telegram

To enable Telegram notifications, you'll need to create a Telegram bot and obtain the chat ID where messages will be sent.

**Create a Telegram Bot**:
- Open the Telegram app and search for @BotFather.
- Start a chat and send the command /newbot.
- Follow the prompts to set up the bot's name and username. After creation, BotFather will provide a bot token. Keep this token secure.

**Obtain Your Chat ID**:
- Add the newly created bot to the desired chat (either a group or personal chat).
- Send a message to the bot in that chat.

To retrieve the chat ID, open a web browser and navigate to:

```bash
https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getUpdates
```

Replace <token> with the token you received from BotFather.

In the JSON response, locate the "chat" object. The "id" field within this object is your chat ID.
